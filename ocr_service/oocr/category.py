"""Category resolution.

The LLM is responsible for picking a category as part of its structured
output. This module just sanity-checks that pick against a small keyword
rule table — if the rules clearly contradict the LLM (e.g. items contain
"بنزين" but the LLM said "other"), we override.

No local model. No HuggingFace download. No sentence-transformers."""
