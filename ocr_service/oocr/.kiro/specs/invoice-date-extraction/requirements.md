# Requirements Document - Complete Invoice Extraction Engine

## Introduction

This feature provides a comprehensive rule-based invoice extraction engine for OCR-extracted invoice text. The system processes bilingual (Arabic and English) invoice text from PaddleOCR and extracts multiple fields including dates, times, total amounts, items with quantities and prices, and invoice categories. The engine uses a candidate-based architecture where multiple candidates are generated for each field, scored based on context and position, and the best candidate is selected with a confidence score.

## Glossary

- **Invoice_Extractor**: The complete system responsible for extracting all invoice fields from OCR text
- **OCR_Text**: Raw text extracted from invoice images using PaddleOCR
- **Candidate**: A potential value for any field (date, time, total, item) with an associated score
- **Scoring_Engine**: The component that calculates confidence scores for candidates based on multiple factors
- **Context_Keyword**: A keyword that indicates proximity to a specific field (e.g., "date", "total", "تاريخ", "الإجمالي")
- **Confidence_Score**: A numerical value (0.0 to 1.0) indicating the likelihood that an extracted value is correct
- **Normalized_Text**: Text after converting Arabic numerals to English, fixing OCR errors, and applying lowercase
- **Valid_Date**: A date string that can be successfully parsed into a datetime object
- **Valid_Time**: A time string that can be successfully parsed into a time object
- **Arabic_Numeral**: Arabic-Indic digits (٠١٢٣٤٥٦٧٨٩)
- **English_Numeral**: Western Arabic digits (0123456789)
- **Date_Format**: A specific pattern for representing dates (e.g., DD/MM/YYYY, YYYY-MM-DD)
- **Time_Format**: A specific pattern for representing times (e.g., HH:MM, HH:MM AM/PM)
- **Total_Amount**: The final total amount on an invoice (not subtotal, tax, or discount)
- **Item**: A structured object containing item name, quantity, and price
- **Category**: The classification of an invoice (restaurant, supermarket, pharmacy, etc.)
- **Line**: A single line of text from the invoice
- **Keyword_Proximity**: The distance in characters between a candidate and its nearest context keyword
- **Document_Position**: The location of a candidate in the document (top, middle, bottom)
